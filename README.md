THIS IS THE SUBMISSION TO MY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

## PROJECT TITLE - AMAZON ANALYSIS
This is a analysis of the highest-rated items reveal a strong consumer preference for affordable yet functional gadgets. Most of the products that earned a rating of 4.7 and above belong to everyday electronics and kitchen appliances. Most users showed high levels of satisfaction even with budget-friendly items, such as USB cables and milk frothers, which received top marks.

Among the standout performers is the Swiffer instant water heater, which  has a near-perfect score but also  an impressive number of reviews indicating both popularity and consistent user satisfaction. Similarly, the Sony Bravia 65" 4K TV, although premium-priced, maintains a high customer rating, suggesting that quality electronics continue to attract and satisfy a loyal audience.

The majority of these well-rated items are heavily discounted—often by more than 50%—suggesting that buyers feel they’re getting great value for money, which likely contributes to positive feedback. Overall, customers tend to reward practicality, reliability, and good pricing with high ratings.
